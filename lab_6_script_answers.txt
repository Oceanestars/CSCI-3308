PART 4: 

Question 1:

DROP TABLE Uni;

CREATE TABLE Uni(
  University_Name VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,            
  Date_Established INT NOT NULL,  
  Address VARCHAR(200),             
  Student_Population INT NOT NULL,		     
  Acceptance_Rate FLOAT(8);             

Question 2:

INSERT INTO Uni (University_Name, Date_Established, Address,Student_Population,Acceptance_Rate)
VALUES('CU Boulder', 1876, '1100 28th St, Boulder, CO 80303',35000,0.8);

PART 5:

Question 1:

SELECT name, major FROM football_players 
ORDER BY major ASC;

Question 2:

SELECT name, rushing_yards FROM football_players WHERE rushing_yards >70 ORDER BY rushing_yards ASC;

Question 3:

SELECT * FROM football_games WHERE (visitor_name = 'Nebraska');

Question 4:

SELECT * FROM football_games WHERE (home_score > visitor_score);

Question 5:

SELECT visitor_name, game_date  FROM football_games WHERE game_date > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '15 months';

Question 6:

 SELECT AVG(home_score) AS "avg" FROM football_games;
(Don't need the AS "avg")

Question 7:

SELECT major, COUNT(major) AS number_of_players FROM football_players GROUP BY major;

Question 8:

SELECT major, COUNT(major) AS number_of_players FROM football_players WHERE (major = 'CSCI') GROUP BY major;

PART 6:

Question 1:

CREATE VIEW wins AS
 SELECT COUNT(football_games) 
 FROM football_games
 WHERE (home_score > visitor_score);

Question 2:

CREATE VIEW total AS
 SELECT COUNT(football_games) 
 FROM football_games;

Question 3:

SELECT (CAST(wins.count as real)/CAST(total.count as real)*100) FROM wins, total;

CAST (...)
Our math operations will try to perserve the data type of the columns being used. This means if our operation works with whole numbers, then our answer will be a whole number. To work around this, we can use CAST() to treat one of our values as a float, which will result in a decimal number for our answer!

PART 7:

Question 1:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM football_games WHERE (SELECT id FROM football_players WHERE name = 'Cedric Vega') = any(players);
 

Question 2:

SELECT CAST(p.rushing_yards AS float) AS "Average Rushing Yards" FROM (SELECT (SELECT rushing_yards FROM football_players WHERE name = 'Cedric Vega') AS rushing_yards, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM football_games WHERE 1 = ANY(players)) AS games_played)p;
